		<p>The image below is my self portrait. We had to gather other images that show our character trait, what we are interested in and put them into a collage on Adobe Photoshop. My main character traits were creativity, gratitude, and humor. I also chose music that I like, Hobbies, and sports that i like to do.</p>

		<p>The image below is my essay from my coding the past interview. As you can see I don't have much written but we were supposed to take something from our interview like a memory or like a favorite food. In my case I chose my grandmothers first car and i used imagery and similies to explain parts of the car.</p>
